# excel-react
React table showing excel data in a table.  Using react-table-v6, https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table-v6
This is a project using React and .net core as a learning exercise.

The 'Fetch' tab will read and display data from an excel file.
The 'Load' tab allows for uploading an Excel file, and joins the data with records from a database.  This tab can also export the results to a .csv.  The 'Complete' button will load a preexisting data set.  It would be used to confirm and update status data in the database.
The table columns are sortable by clicking on the column text, ascending/descending.
